Client-Server Visualization and Modeling.

Below are the steps to be followed for client server visualization model

1. Clone/Download the repository
2. Run the flask server using "python ScriptName" (For instance: python flask_roc.py)
3. Above step will start the flask app and provides url.
4. Change the directory path to src and execute "python3 -m http.server" in a new terminal.
5. This will start the server locally at a port (Mostly 8000)
6. Go to the URL using any borwser, where you will asked to select a scaling method and Value of Inverse of regularization strength 'C'.
7. Once the information is provided, please hit submit.
8. You will able to see the model performance using ROC curve plot.
9. Change the value of 'C' to tune the model performance.
